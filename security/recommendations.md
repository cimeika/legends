# Security Recommendations

- Keep dependencies updated and monitor for known vulnerabilities.
- Enforce HTTPS and TLS for all communications.
- Use parameterized queries and ORM features to prevent SQL injection.
- Store secrets and configuration in environment variables or secret managers, not in code.
- Implement rate limiting and input validation to protect against brute-force and injection attacks.
- Maintain regular backups and monitor logs for suspicious activity.
- Apply the principle of least privilege for all services and users.
