CiWiki serves as the documentation hub for the Cimeika ecosystem—an interactive platform that helps organize time, creativity, emotional state, and communication. The system combines automation, personalization, and clear communication to optimize how users spend their time and foster a harmonious digital environment.

This page provides an entry point to the broader knowledge base and links to modules such as the central assistant, event planner, mood tracker, creative space, calendar, and gallery. Additional sections cover integrations, security, and architectural details of the platform.
